# Decision Maker Project

## What does your program decide?
This program helps the user decide the best study method based on:
-The subject they are studying
-How much time they have
-Their learning style

## What's one interesting if/elif/else you used?
One interesting part of the program is how it checks the available study time first.
Depending on whether the time is short, medium, or long, the program uses if, elif,
and else statements to choose different study strategies that best fit the user.

## What AI prompt helped you most?
The AI prompt that helped me most was asking for help creating a beginner-friendly
decision-making program in Python using if, elif, and else.
